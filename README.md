# Introduction

Social capital ties are ubiquitous in modern life. For societies with people and landscapes tightly connected, in variable or marginal ecosystems, and with unreliable market sectors, social relations are critical. Each relation is a potential source of food, information, cash, labor, or expertise. 
In the aforementioned paper, we present an analysis of multiplex, directed, and weighted networks representing actual flows of subsistence-related goods and services among households in three remote indigenous Alaska communities exposed to both extreme climate change and industrial development. We find that the principal challenge to the robustness of such communities is the loss of key households and the erosion of cultural ties linked to sharing and cooperative social relations rather than resource depletion.

# Description

Three files are provided. Each file contains one network, corresponding to a specific Alaska community, namely

* Kaktovi (37 layers, 164 nodes)
* Venetie (43 layers, 206 nodes)
* Wainwright (36 layers, 218 nodes)

in extended edgelist format:
